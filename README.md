### The Goal of the Analysis:
After scraping data scientist job description from Indeed, I will preprocess job descriptions and generate job description

### About the Analysis:
Language Modelling is the core problem for a number of of natural language processing tasks such as speech to text, conversational system, and text summarization. A trained language model learns the likelihood of occurrence of a word based on the previous sequence of words used in the text. Language models can be operated at character level, n-gram level, sentence level or even paragraph level. In this analysis, I will explain how to create a language model for generating natural language text by implement and training state-of-the-art Recurrent Neural Network.
